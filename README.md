Creating a webpage
"Attempt to make a recipe page"

"In this exercise, I have been able to practice basic html commands and building a multi-page website through relative links. I feel more confident with the following processes: adding links (relative and absolute), changing directories, adding and moving files, adding and committing in git, adjusting text including lists, adding images, creating boilerplate from memory, and using the above commands from memory."
