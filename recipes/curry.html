    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbls coconut oil</li>
        <li>16 oz boneless chicken breast, cubed</li>
        <li>14 oz coconut milk</li>
        <li>11 oz bottle red Thai curry sauce</li>
        <li>16 oz package dried rice stick vermicelli noodles</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet on high heat. Add chicken cubes; cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Reduce heat to medium-high and add coconut cream and curry sauce. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in vermicelli pasta and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Reduce skillet heat to simmer. Add the noodles and let simmer until flavors are absorbed, about 5 minutes. Divide chicken and noodles among individual serving bowls.</li>
    </ol>
